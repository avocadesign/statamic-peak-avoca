# Project-Specific Information

## Project Structure
- Navigation views: `resources/views/navigation` from upstream should be merged into `resources/views/layout/navigation` in this fork

## Page Builder Customizations
- Do not include the "cards" page builder block from upstream - this fork does not use it

## Component Preferences
- Text component uses `span-lg` class (not upstream's `span-md`)
